I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Environment and Society](https://qcnr.usu.edu/envs/) at Utah State University where I study agricultural adaptation to changing climate.  

I completed my a dual-undergraduate degree in Economics at Clemson University and the Universit√© Catholique de Louvain, Belgium, where I also completed a Masters in Economics in 2012.  After my masters, I moved to Vanderbilt University where I completed a Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering in 2017.
