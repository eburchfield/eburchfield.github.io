My research integrates social and environmental data to understand the distributional consequences of changing climate on humans and the environment. I rely heavily on geospatial programming and analysis, but also integrate survey and qualitative data.  My current research focuses on future food and water security in in the United States and the impact of landscape on agricultural production.
