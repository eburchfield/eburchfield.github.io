Using the highest, average, and lowest decadal rates of technologically driven increases in crop yields over the 1980 to 2017 period, we develop spatially explicit yield scenarios to the end of the twenty-first century under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. We find that with static technological innovation, severe climate change will decrease yields by an average of 22.4 percent (26.1 bu. ac???1) for maize, 27.9 percent (8.83 bu. ac???1) for soybeans, and 20 percent (7.14 bu. ac???1) for winter wheat in the central USA; however, with even the lowest rates of technological yield growth, yields increase by an average of 25.0 percent (40.5 bu. ac???1) for maize and 30.2 percent (14.2 bu. ac???1) for soybeans. We conclude that technology has the potential to overcome the negative impacts of climate change on the yields of maize, soybeans, and winter wheat in the central USA, but if these increases are to be environmentally sustainable, technological developments must be informationintensive rather than input-intensive.","tags":["Future Cropscapes","Yield","Agricultural Adaptation","Projection"],"title":"Changing yields in the central US under climate and technological change","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dr. Emily Burchfield","Kate Nelson","Kaitlyn Spangler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"ee545287e4d9a4f5b00c9e3333a40982","permalink":"/publication/2019_aee/","publishdate":"2019-07-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_aee/","section":"publication","summary":"This research uses hierarchical Bayesian models to estimate the relationship between landscape-scale agricultural diversity and the yields of corn, soy, and winter wheat in the coterminous United States.

Our findings also indicate that (1) crop production is more responsive to the number of distinct crop types cultivated on a landscape than their cultivated extent and that (2) increasing diversity in agricultural systems that are already diverse brings the highest yield gains.
