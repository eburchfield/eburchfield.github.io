## Current Projects

#### Agricultural diversity and yield

* *Funded by a [USU RGS Research Catalyst Grant](http://rgs.usu.edu/rd/rc/)*
* National study of the relationship between landscape composition and agricultural production. 

#### Agricultural resilience to climate stress

* *Funded by the [Utah Agricultrual Experiment Station](https://uaes.usu.edu/)*
* Identification of the shared characteristics of agricultural systems showing resilience to extreme heat and water stress over the last 30 years in the continental United States.  

#### Future yield and cultivated area 

* Spatially explicit projections of yield and cultivated extent for major crops in the United States.

#### Moulouya Water Conservation

* *Funded by the [Borlaug Food Security Graduate Student Fellowship](https://www.fas.usda.gov/programs/borlaug-fellowship-program)*
* This project investigates the relationship between irrigation pond adoption and water conservation outcomes in the Moulouya River Basin of northeastern Morocco.
