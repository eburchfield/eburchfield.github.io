Future changes in climate will significantly transform US agriculture both through changes in _production_ and the _production geography_ of many crops.Through iterative participatory modeling, this project will generate productions of future production geographies of major crops cultivated in the Central and Eastern US under multiple stakeholder-generated scenarios of climatic and sociotechnical change.
