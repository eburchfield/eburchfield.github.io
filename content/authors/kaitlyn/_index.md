Kaitlyn Spangler is working toward her PhD in [Environment and Society](https://www.usu.edu/degrees/index.cfm?id=30) at Utah State University. She holds a BA in Anthropology and a BS in Community, Environment, and Development from Penn State University (2016), as well as an MS in Geography from Virginia Tech (2018). Her current research utilizes qualitative and quantitative data across multiple scales to better understand the sociopolitical and ecological tradeoffs associated with land use diversification and farmer decision-making. Her previous research relied heavily on in-depth qualitative methodologies focused on household food security, gender, and sustainable agricultural practices in East Africa and Nepal. Currently, her PhD research aims to work methodologically integrate large-scale geospatial data analysis and lived experiences of farmers in the U.S. context to understand how agricultural systems can be more sustainable and resilient. Other interests include long-distance running, gardening, and critical conversations over coffee.
